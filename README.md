# 🏏 Cricket Game

A fun little **Bat-Ball-Stump** game inspired by Rock-Paper-Scissors!  
You play against the computer, and it keeps track of your **wins, losses, and ties** during the session.  

Currently in its **early phase**, but already a light and addictive way to pass time ⚡

## 🎮 How it Works
